# chessbot

A simple trial of a chessbot in C

Project intended to learn algorithms by intuition, so I have by choice avoided learning about existing board representations and algorithms.

# To Do:
- Implement the 50 move rule
- Implement draw by repetition
- Replace the negaMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning or MCTS
- Implement a proper evaluation function. Current one only evaluates by heuristic value
- of the chess pieces.
- Implement a UCI (Universal Chess Interface) interface.
- Replace current board representation with something more efficient.
- Implement noise into move algorithms

# Known bugs:
